-- This file is now very minimalistic since sequelize applies the structure for the schema from the files in the models folder.  The database only has to be created and can be done so by executing this code in MySQL Workbench, or in the terminal  from the MySQL shell
-- DROP DATABASE
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ecommerce_db;

-- CREATE DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
